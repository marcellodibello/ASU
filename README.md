# Research projects

My [research statement](research/research-statement.pdf) gives an overview of new and ongoing projects. 

## Algorithmic fairness (new project)

* Grant [proposal](research/algorithmic-fairness.pdf) - under review by PSC CUNY (internal CUNY grant)


## Weight of evidence (new project)

* Grant [proposal](research/weight-of-evidence.pdf) - under review by the National Endowment for the Humanities

* Project [website](https://www.weightofevidenceproject.org/) - work in progress!

## Cross-examination (new project)
 
Is Cross-examination an Engine for the Discovery of Truth? - [project proposal](research/cross.pdf)  

## Statistics in the law (ongoing project)

This project examines the use of statistics at trial, especially as a lens to think 
about the risks of mistaken decisions and the rights of defendants against these risks.

I am now working on a book project weaving 
together different parts of my scholarship on statistical 
evidence in the criminal trial.

* [Statistics in the Criminal Trial: What Are We Afraid of?](research/book-proposal.pdf) -- book project
